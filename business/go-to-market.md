#### Engage

Have a text conversation to better understand them and what they want.

"How do you like to spend your free time?"


#### Celebrate. 

Notify success of others.

# Funding

## National Government

### Pros
- Social isolation is a priority costing the British economy Â£32 billion every year. [The Cost of Disconnected Communities]

[The Cost of Disconnected Communities][https://www.edenprojectcommunities.com/sites/default/files/The%20Cost%20of%20Disconnected%20Communities%20Digital%20Toolkit%20-%20Eden%20Project%20Communities.pdf]

### Cons
- National government struggles to pay for things right now.
- Slow.

## Local Government

### Pros
- Social isolation is a priority for Dagenham. They are actively searching for neighbourhood level solutions that empower local communities to, themselves, be part of the solution.
- No expensive system to deploy e.g. Breezie - can take advantage of existing device ownership. 

### Cons

- There may not be budget to support the platform cost (SMS @ 5p per round trip)

## Local business - advertising venues

The idea is that they would publish their place of a business as a good spot for small-wins social events to take place.

### Pros

- Service pays for itself - doesn't cost council or users anything

### Cons

- Business may not "advertise"
- Could have dodgy businesses "advertising"

## End User

### Pros 

- Helps drive engagement - people are more likely to use what they pay for


### Cons

- Social isolation linked to limited financial resources
