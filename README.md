We are working to solve social isolation for the Barking and Dagenham Borough of London.

Resources:

- [Red Cross - ISOLATION AND LONELINESS An overview of the literature]

Most affected by isolation in the borough 45 - 50 years old due to:
- mobilty
- divorce
- retiring
- death of partner
- reduction in mobility
- lack of economic resources
- lack of access to technology

GP's do not have a comprehensive enough list of social activities and that prevents them from giving out social prescriptions.
