We are working to solve social isolation for the Barking and Dagenham Borough of London.

Resources:

- [Red Cross - ISOLATION AND LONELINESS An overview of the literature]

Most affected by isolation in the borough 45 - 50 years old due to:
- mobilty
- divorce
- retiring
- death of partner
- reduction in mobility
- lack of economic resources
- lack of access to technology

GP's do not have a comprehensive enough list of social activities and that prevents them from giving out social prescriptions.

# The big idea

Small-Wins is a text-message based service that facilitates social engagement. The user journey is as follows:

## Registration

1. User registers or gets registered for service (by GP, Council worker, etc.)
2. Language? 
    English / Urdu / etc.
3. "How many times a week do you engage with your community?"
    Never (1) -> Daily (10)
4. "In 3 months how frequently do you wish you could engage with your community?"
    Never (1) -> Daily (10)
5. "What are your hobbies?"
    None / Knitting / Listening to music

## Activity

1. SMS: "There are some things going on today - what do you want to attend: (1) coffee shop with a few others. (2) pub with a few others. (3) knitting group [scraped from meetup.com]. (4) Not today"
2. Responds with "3"
3. SMS: "Okay great, the group is meeting at costa coffee on commercial road at 4pm."

## After activity
1. SMS: "Did you enjoy the coffee meetup?"
2. SMS: "Any chance you remember the names of the people you met? It helps us check who attended."
3. SMS: "Rate the location (1) Terrible -> (10) Great "

## Repeat

Activities repeat at regular intervals (every few days).


# Gotchas

1. What if there are no meetups?

We can facilitate meetings using other members of the app in the local area. If this is done, we will ensure that a few members of local volunteer groups are present to smooth social interactions.


2. Why hasn't this been done already
3. What if no one goes to an event
4. What if people only go to one event and don't go to any others.

# Opportunities

1. Work across languages - defeats isolation brought about by being alone in a group. Meetup with others in the area that speak the same language. Auto-translate.
2. Work with loc
3. Figure out interests based on social media information
4.
