We are working to solve social isolation for the Barking and Dagenham Borough of London.

Resources:

- [Red Cross - ISOLATION AND LONELINESS An overview of the literature]

Most affected by isolation in the borough 45 - 50 years old due to:
- mobilty
- divorce
- retiring
- death of partner
- reduction in mobility
- lack of economic resources
- lack of access to technology

GP's do not have a comprehensive enough list of social activities and that prevents them from giving out social prescriptions.

### Key challenges to social prescribing:

According to a 2017 survey of 560 GPs, the key barriers to using social prescribing more are:
- Lack of information about available services (40% said they would refer more if they had more information about available services)
- Lack of funding
- Perception of role and responsibilities (some GP's don't see it as their responsibility as it is non-medical)
- Perception of negative political implications (some GP's felt that it places unfair burden on charities and community groups to support vulnerable people)

### Key benefits of social prescribing:

- Freeing up GP and hospital resources (shown to have the potential to cut GP consultation rates by 28% and A&E attendance by 24%)
- Increases the feeling of control and self-confidence in participants
- Reduces social isolation 
- Has a positive impact on health-related behaviours, including weight loss, healthier eating and increased physical activity. 
- Improved management of long-term conditions
- Improved mental health
- Greater resilience and more effective problem-solving strategies

### Current situation in England

Professor Drinkwater chairs Ways to Wellness, a charitable foundation set up to deliver social prescribing at scale in Newcastle upon Tyne. 

He says that the picture of social prescribing in England is “a very mixed bag at the moment”, adding that there have been lots of pilots which often fizzle out and miss the chance to have a lasting impact.

“We need to stop talking about pilots – because they get dropped. We need to have prototypes instead, which get developed.”
